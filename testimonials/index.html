                  <p>“  This is our second year using their services to clean our roof and gutter. In both occasions, Dylan went out of his way to fit us in right before a storm was coming. Our roof has a history of leaking, and he went to great care to follow up and show the work he did. Lastly, I found their rates significantly better than three other quotes I received. You can see why we keep turning back each year to use their service!  ”</p>

I was unaware of the accumulation of dirt on my windows and the dust on my screens. It elevated the concept of Spring Cleaning to a whole new level. I highly recommend their services, and you won't be disappointed! Additionally, Dylan & Co. are the sweetest!  ”</p>

               <p>“  First off I have a ton of windows and even more solar panels. I don’t usually wash my panels but there was a large fire close the day before Rodgers were to arrive. There was soot everywhere on my window sills and the solar panels were thick with it. Rodgers did a great job! Windows are sparkling inside and out including the screens. Trust me there was no shine on my panels this picture was taken through the windows. This is the 2nd time I have used Rodgers but the first for inside and the panels. I will not hire anyone else  ”</p>

House looked amazing… windows, inside and out looked fantastic. Never realized how much dirt on windows inside and out build up. Gutters were cleared out too. Very happy with service and will use them again. Very professional and courteous. Thank you Roger’s Windows for an excellent customer experience  ”</p>

               <p>“  Dylan and his team did an excellent job cleaning our gutters - they even cleared the leaves from our driveway which was a huge win. He was able to generate a quote over the phone by looking up our house on Google Earth with a reasonable price. He is friendly, professional and prompt, even working through recovering from an injury. We plan on using them every year now!  ”</p>

He even spent extra time to make sure additional details were cared for that he hadn't included in his estimate. Dylan went above and beyond to make sure we were happy with his work and we appreciate him and his excellent customer service. We'll definitely be working with him again.
